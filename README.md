You can spam discord messages using this simple script.


Usage:

1) Run the vbs script.

2) Enter the message to spam and click OK

3) Enter the amount of messages you want to spam (must be numbers) and click OK.

4) Enter a delay time in ms (for discord I use 1000 ms = 1 sec)

5) Choose if you want to use antispam bypasser or not

6a) If you choose YES, enter a number! Higher is the better (I use 10,000,000)!

6b) If you choose NO, you don't need to do anything else on the 7th step.

8) After you entered your number (or choosen NO) click ok.

8) Now you should see a message box, saying your message, your amount of messages and your delay.

9) After you click OK on the msgbox,you have 3 seconds to go to your discord.

10) Have fun :D


IMPORTANT: Please note that the 1 second delay is required between the messages because if it's less, 90% of the internet connections can not send them, they will stack and discord will say that you are chatting too fast!
