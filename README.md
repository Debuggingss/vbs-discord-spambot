You can spam discord messages using this simple script. Usage:

Run the vbs script.
Enter the message to spam and click ok.
Enter the amount of messages you want to spam (must be numbers).
Click OK.
Now you should see a message box, saying your message and a number.
After you click OK on the msgbox you have 3 seconds to go to your discord.
Have fun :D
Please note that the 1 second delay is required between the messages because if it's less, 90% of the internet connections can not send them, they will stack and discord will say that you are chatting too fast!
