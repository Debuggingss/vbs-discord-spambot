You can spam discord messages using this simple script. Usage:

1) Run the vbs script.
2) Enter the message to spam and click ok.
3)Enter the amount of messages you want to spam (must be numbers).
4)Click OK.
5)Now you should see a message box, saying your message and a number.
6)After you click OK on the msgbox you have 3 seconds to go to your discord.
7)Have fun :D


IMPORTANT: Please note that the 1 second delay is required between the messages because if it's less, 90% of the internet connections can not send them, they will stack and discord will say that you are chatting too fast!
